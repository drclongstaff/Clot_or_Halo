Shiny app to analyse clotting or halo fibrinolysis curves
These files are part of a collection of programs and notes that deal with enzyme assays in the area of haemostasis.
The Shiny app in this folder can be used to analyse clotting curves, of fibrinogen or plasma with thrombin, for example.
Alternatively the app can be used to analyse fibrinolysis curves generated from halo assays.
More help is available in the detailed help notes.
